# Elasticsearch How-To

### Zero Point
First of all you have to download two main tools:
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch);
- [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana).

Important notes:

   1. Elasticsearch requires at least Java 8, it is recommended to use the Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_131;
   2. Starting with version 6.0.0 Kibana only supports 64 bit operating systems, so if you are using earlier versions you should upgrade or just simply create the index **before** indexing data.

Elasticsearch is basically a search engine and Kibana is a tool for data visualization.
We will index some data to the first one and create a dashboard with the second one.

Now everything is ready to go.

### Initial setup
Since is Kibana that connects to Elasticsearch, let's run Elasticsearch first.

Expected Elasticsearch's output:
> [2018-03-30T17:32:46,525][INFO ][o.e.n.Node] [T7Twj0J] started

Expected Kibana's output:
>  log   [15:45:50.267] [info][status][plugin:elasticsearch@6.2.2] Status changed from yellow to green - Ready

If you are not getting these outputs I suggest you to dig in the corresponding documentation.

Now that everything is up and running:

1. Index some data: `python3.6 twint.py --elasticsearch localhost:9200 -u user --database twint.db` (the `--database` arg is optional, `--elasticsearch` is mandatory and its value is for default settings, as in our case;

2. Now we can create the index (that I already created): open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5601` (again, this is a default value), `Dev Tools` tab, copy&paste `index-tweets.json` and than click the green arrow. Expected output is 

```json
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "shards_acknowledged": true,
  "index": "twint"
}
```

3. Go to `Management` tab, `Index Patterns`, `Create Index Pattern`, `Index Pattern: twint` and choose `datestamp` as time field;

4. Go to the `Discover` tab, choose `twint` and you should see something like this:

### Notes

Different indexes can have different visualizations so there is not a general rule, with the basics provided in the Wiki you should be able to create visualizations. In any case, for every question, don't hesitate to ask.
